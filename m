Makes sense now that I'm looking at other snippets, thanks.

I can't get it to match on something like

	long a, b = 42;

Perhaps a roundabout way of getting there - would it be possible to
specify a rule where an identifier has to be a variable? That way I could
at least print their use and cross-check the output diff (I don't expect
multiple variables declaration to be common for this, but would like to
have some way of raising a flag when it does occur).

Thanks for the pointers & swift reply! Much appreciated.
