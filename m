First of all, thanks for doing that! It sounds a lot better to have
a script doing the check than newbies trying to address it manually,
as there are several aspects to be considered on such replacement.

Long story short, I got a corner case where the script is doing
the wrong thing.

A detailed explanation follows:

As you know, I'm doing some manual work to address issues related
to pm_runtime_get() on media.

There, I found a corner case: There is a functional difference
between:

	ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(&client->dev);
        if (ret < 0) {
                pm_runtime_put_noidle(&client->dev);
		return ret;
	}

and:
	ret = pm_runtime_resume_and_get(&client->dev);
        if (ret < 0)
		return ret;

On success, pm_runtime_get_sync() can return either 0 or 1.
When 1 is returned, it means that the driver was already resumed.

pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), on the other hand, don't have the same
behavior. On success, it always return zero.

IMO, this is actually a good thing, as it helps to address a common
mistake:

	ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(&client->dev);
	/*
	 * or, even worse: 
	 * ret = some_function_that_calls_pm_runtime_get_sync(); 
	 */

        if (ret) {
                pm_runtime_put_noidle(&client->dev);
		return ret;
	}

FYI, Dan pointed one media driver to me those days with the above
issue at the imx334 driver, which I'm fixing on my patch series. 

-

Anyway, after revisiting my patches, I found several cases that were 
doing things like:

	int ret;

	ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
	pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev);		/* Or without it, on drivers with unbalanced get/put */

	return ret > 0 ? 0 : ret;

Which can be replaced by just:

	return pm_runtime_resume_and_get(&ctx->gsc_dev->pdev->dev);

Yet, I found a single corner case on media where a driver is actually 
using the positive return: the ccs-core camera sensor driver.

There, the driver checks the past state of RPM. If the
device was indeed suspended, the driver restores the hardware
controls (on V4L2, a control is something like brightness, 
contrast, etc) to the last used value set.

This is the right thing to be done there, as setting values
to such hardware can be a slow operation, as it is done via I2C.

So, this particular driver checks if the RPM returned 0 or 1,
in order to check the previous RPM state before get.

In this particular case, replacing:
	pm_runtime_get_sync()
with
	pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

Will make part of the code unreachable. 

While it won't break this specific driver, It could have
cause troubles if the logic there were different.

In any case, I tested the coccinelle script, and it produces
this change:

 static int ccs_pm_get_init(struct ccs_sensor *sensor)
 {
        struct i2c_client *client = v4l2_get_subdevdata(&sensor->src->sd);
        int rval;
 
-       rval = pm_runtime_get_sync(&client->dev);
-       if (rval < 0) {
-               pm_runtime_put_noidle(&client->dev);
+       rval = pm_runtime_resume_and_get(&client->dev);
+       if (rval < 0)
 
                return rval;
-       } else if (!rval) {
+       else if (!rval) {
                rval = v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup(&sensor->pixel_array->
                                               ctrl_handler);
                if (rval)
                        return rval;
 
                return v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup(&sensor->src->ctrl_handler);
        }
 
        return 0;

which will make v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() to always being called,
even if the device was already resumed.

Thanks,
Mauro
