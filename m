spatch doens't care about virtual.  Identifier is fine.  If the code is
really as simple as you have presented it, ie with the type of m declared
immediately before its use, then there may be a problem with parsing the
code.  Run spatch --parse-c on a file that you think should be changed and
see if BAD or bad come out in front of the code that should be
changed.nYOu can also run spatch --parse-c on the entire directory (may
require removing any limits on the stack size).  That will conclude by
telling you the tokens it is most unhappy with.  You can often get away
with defining a few dummy macros.

If none of that works, please send a small function that illustrates the
problem and the complete semantic patch.
